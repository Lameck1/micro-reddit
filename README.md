## About Project

This project is about working with models, a part of the Model View Controller architecture. Model is the layer of the MVC system which is responsible for representing business data and logic. 

In this project, we build data structures necessary to support creation of posts and users commenting on posts. It is a mini Rails app without the front end. 

## Built With

- Ruby v2.7.2
- Rails 6
- SQLite3

## Getting Started

* Clone this repo https://github.com/Lameck1/micro-reddit
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Lameck1/micro-reddit.git
    ```
* Navigate to micro-reddit folder
    ```
    cd micro-reddit
    ```
* On the terminal, while in the 'micro-reddit' directory, run the following to install dependency:
    ```
    bundle install
    ```
* At this point, you still don't have the SQLite database. Run the following to get setup:
    ```
    rails db:migrate
    ```
* To interact with the project, run:
    ```
    rails console
    ```

    OR

    ```
    rails c
    ```
